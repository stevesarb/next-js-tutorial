All components within the app folder are server components by default

For components requiring interactivity, we must render those client-side
    - Try to render as few components as possible on the client-side
        - Speed
        - Security
        - SEO

Rendering:
    - Client-side
    - Server-side
        - Static (at build time)
            - Build time is building the code for production
        - Dynamic (at request time)
            - When browser sends http request to server for page
